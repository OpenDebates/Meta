# Code of Conduct - Open Debates Project

The Open Debates Project is an open-source project that aims to develop mathematical models for the digital verification of argument soundness. To foster a positive and inclusive community, we have established this Code of Conduct, which applies to all projects within the scope of the Open Debates Project. All participants are expected to adhere to these guidelines in order to maintain a friendly and respectful environment.

## Reporting Grievances

If you have any grievances related to any project within the Open Debates Project, such as accusations or concerns about inappropriate behavior, please address them in a private manner. The appropriate channel for reporting grievances is by contacting the Steering Council or the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) privately. 

Please do not publicize details of your grievances until after an investigation has concluded. Publicizing grievances prematurely will result in voiding impeachments and the barring of accused members from the community. Additionally, it is important to provide evidence to support any claims of inappropriate behavior to ensure fair and objective evaluations.

You can contact the BDFL via email at vivek@opendebates.net for reporting any grievances.

## Compliance with Laws

All participants in any project within the Open Debates Project are expected to comply with the laws of their respective countries while engaging in these projects. Violations of legal obligations will not be tolerated.

## Appropriateness in Communication

To ensure a professional and inclusive atmosphere, it is essential that all communication within the projects adheres to certain standards:

1. **Inappropriate Content**: Do not portray or send inappropriate content in any public channels or areas of the projects. This includes but is not limited to offensive language, explicit material, or discriminatory content.

2. **Politics**: Political content should not be discussed in public venues within the projects. Our focus is solely on the development and advancement of mathematical models for argument verification.

## Active Participation

We encourage all participants to contribute actively and genuinely to the projects within the Open Debates Project in order to promote their health and longevity. Here are some guidelines for active participation:

1. **Consideration and Respect**: Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions towards other participants. Treat everyone with professionalism and courtesy.

2. **Collaboration over Conflict**: Whenever possible, attempt collaboration and seek common ground to resolve conflicts or disagreements instead of resorting to confrontational behavior.

3. **Demeaning, Discriminatory, or Harassing Behavior**: Refrain from engaging in any form of demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior or speech. Treat others with kindness, empathy, and professionalism.

4. **Awareness of Surroundings**: Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants. If you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, please alert the community leaders promptly, even if the situation seems inconsequential.

5. **Respect Public Event Venues**: During community events or gatherings related to the Open Debates Project, remember that event venues may be shared with members of the public. Please be respectful to all patrons of these locations during project-related activities.

## Amendments

This Code of Conduct may be amended from time to time by consensus of the Steering Council. Any proposed amendments must be made in writing and shared with the project's community for review and feedback. The final decision on amendments will be made by the Steering Council after considering the input received.

All participants in any project within the Open Debates Project are expected to follow the updated Code of Conduct once amendments have been approved and implemented.

By following these guidelines, we can create a positive and inclusive environment where all participants in projects within the Open Debates Project can thrive intellectually and socially.

Thank you for your contribution to the Open Debates Project!
