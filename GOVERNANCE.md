# Open Debates Project Governance Structure

## Overview

The Open Debates Project is an open-source initiative focused on developing mathematical models for the digital verification of soundness of arguments. This document outlines the governance structure for the project, which is designed to ensure effective decision-making, accountability, and inclusivity in the project's operations.

## Leadership

At the top of the governance hierarchy is the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). The current BDFL of the Open Debates Project is Vivek Joshy, who can be contacted via email at vivek@opendebates.net. The BDFL holds ultimate authority over the project and has the power to veto any decisions made by other bodies within the governance structure.

## Steering Council

The BDFL appoints a Steering Council, which consists of trusted members who assist in key decision-making processes. The Steering Council is responsible for making decisions related to project management, setting overall goals and direction, as well as overseeing the work of working groups. However, it's important to note that any decisions made by the Steering Council can be reverted by the BDFL at any time.

The appointment of collaborators to various levels within a working group follows a meritocracy-based approach. Merit is defined as having made contributions based on sound arguments or obtaining the approval of the BDFL. The Steering Council considers these criteria when appointing collaborators.

## Working Groups

The Steering Council may establish working groups comprised of one or more collaborators. These working groups focus on specific sub-tasks and goals within the Open Debates Project. Collaborators within these working groups are responsible for actively contributing towards the achievements of these goals and tasks.

## Contributors and Collaborators

By default, individuals whose contributions are utilized within the Open Debates Project are deemed contributors. However, being a contributor does not automatically grant collaborator status. Collaborators are a subset of contributors who have been appointed to work within specific levels of working groups. All collaborators are contributors, but not all contributors are collaborators.

## Amendment

Amendments to the governance structure may be proposed by any collaborator or the Steering Council. Proposed amendments should be submitted in writing to the BDFL for consideration. The BDFL holds the final authority to approve or reject any proposed amendments.

## Formation

The Open Debates Project is formed under the leadership of the BDFL, Vivek Joshy. The BDFL has the power to make initial appointments to the Steering Council and establish the governance structure. The formation of working groups and their composition fall under the jurisdiction of the Steering Council.

## Dissolution

In the event that the Open Debates Project is dissolved, the BDFL will announce the dissolution publicly and communicate the process for archiving project assets and data.
